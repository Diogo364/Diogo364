### ABOUT ME

I am passionate by that feeling when you understand and learn something for the first time. That is what drives me professionally.
My first major was in Biological Science (Universidade de Brasília), where I improved my Critial Thinking, Curiosity, and learned the Scientific Method.
I worked as a Biology Teacher for alomost 2 years, when I decided to change my life completely and start a new carrer in Computer Science from scratch, which was the best professional decision in my life.
